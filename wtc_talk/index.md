## Research: Tree carbon uptake and carbon allocation
<hr>
<br />

* How are trees optimized for C gain?
  + physiology, resource distribution and anatomy
  + will future global change affect these processes?
  
<br />
* Where does this C go?
  + fate of photosynthetic C through trees
  + source vs sink activity
  + providing empirical data to models

## Resource allocation is important at multiple scales
<hr>
<br />

***=left
  + Resource allocation (H<sub>2</sub>0, N, P) regulates leaf photosynthesis
  + Canopy light gradients control resource distribution which alters leaf physiological behavior
  + Sum uptake of all leaves determines net canopy C uptake
  + Canopy C must then be allocated, as a resource, to growth, storage, reproduction and loss

## Whole Tree Chambers, Hawkesbury Forest Experiment
<hr>
<br />
* Novel experimental infrastructure with 12 chambers, 1 tree per each
  +imported to HIE from Sweden
  +retrofitted to work in Australian climate
  
<br />
* Use to address some knowledge gaps in canopy C gain and tree C allocation
  +across multiple scales

## Whole Tree Chambers, Hawkesbury Forest Experiment
<hr>
<br />
* Manipulate climate change factors
  + CO<sub>2</sub>, Precipation and Warming
  + interactions between these factors
<br />
* excellent environmental control:
  + tight control of temperature and RH allow VPD to be controlled in warming experiments
  + real time control of CO<sub>2</sub> levels allows for ^13C studies to be completed

## Whole Tree Chambers, Hawkesbury Forest Experiment
<hr>
<br />
* What they are:
  + tools for plant physiological research
  + excellent manipulative control of climate change factors
  + a step beyond seedling based physiology experiments
  + access to entire canopy
  <br />
  <br />
* What they are not:
  + a proxy for ecosystem level processes

- Driven by resistances to CO<sub>2</sub> into leaves and then to the site of carboxylation
- Stomatal <strong>(g<sub>s</sub>)</strong> and mesophyll <strong>(g<sub>m</sub>)</strong> conductance both limit photosynthesis
