## Now I would like to move up in scale and talk about canopy fluxes and whole tree C allocation
## Using the unique ability of the WTC to measure high resoultion C and H20 fluxes
## extremly relevant for predicting climate change effects on forest ecosystems
## as we want to determine how net canopy C gain is allocated and does this change

* Manipulate climate change factors
  + CO<sub>2</sub>, Precipation and Warming
  + interactions between these factors
<br />
* excellent environmental control:
  + tight control of temperature and RH allow VPD to be controlled in warming experiments
  + real time control of CO<sub>2</sub> levels allows for ^13C studies to be completed
