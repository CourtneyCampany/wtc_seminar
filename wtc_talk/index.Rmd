## Whole Tree Chambers, Hawkesbury Forest Experiment
## climate change manipulations
## what they are:
## what they are not:

--- .class #id bg:white

## My interests revolve around understanding plant C gain and allocation
## 1. how trees are optimized for C gain
## 2. where does the C go
## Answering these question requires research that spans both leaf and whole tree scales

## Today Ill show data from two experiments (WTCI and WTCIII)
## Attempt to address some knowledge gaps in canopy C gain and tree C allocation
## across mulptiple scales


--- .class #id bg:white

## These experiments are conducted with Eucalpytus species
## Why are eucalpyts important?
## Why do they make really nice model trees in investigate physiology

--- .class #id bg:white

## So today we will start small and work are way up...

##Functional properties of **Eucalpytus** leaves and canopies

> - checklist here of findings on leaf angle (king...for leaf temp control in hot dry regions, but occur in wetter regions )
> - stomata on both sides ()
> - sunfleck research focuses heavily on understory, but what about within the canopy
> - Eucakpys tend to have a much sparser canopy than say a a oak tree, also everygreen so C gain year round
> - enhancing light interception is so important in canopy C gain, and for us as we scale up

## Now I would like to move up in scale and talk about canopy fluxes and whole tree C allocation
## Using the unique ability of the WTC to measure high resoultion C and H20 fluxes
## extremly relevant for predicting climate change effects on forest ecosystems
## as we want to determine how net canopy C gain is allocated and does this change

##drawbacks to these study are real
###integrated soil respirtion measuremnets
## but if the power of WTC design allows us to resolve these much more simply

##chamber setup for fluxes
##seperate of soil respirtory flux (important)

##allometry of aboveground, done extremely well
