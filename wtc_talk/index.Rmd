## Reproducibility

## Whole Tree Chambers, Hawkesbury Forest Experiment
## climate change manipulations
## what they are:
## what they are not:

--- .class #id bg:white

## My interests revolve around understanding plant C gain and allocation
## Necessary to investigate leaf and whole plant scales


--- .class #id bg:white

## Today Ill show data from two experiments (WTCI and WTCIII)
## Attempt to address some knowledge gaps in canopy C gain and tree C allocation


--- .class #id bg:white

## These experiments are conducted with Eucalpytus species
## Why are eucalpyts important?
## Why do they make really nice model trees in investigate physiology

--- .class #id bg:white

## So today we will start small and work are way up...

#Coupled response of stomatal and mesophyll conductance to light enhances photosynthesis of shade leaves under sunflecks

## Leaves are reported to have an optimized behavior

### They should act to maximize carbon gain while minimizing costs

## Photosynthesis is a diffusion process

<br />
- Driven by resistances to CO<sub>2</sub> into leaves and then to the site of carboxylation
- Stomatal <strong>(g<sub>s</sub>)</strong> and mesophyll <strong>(g<sub>m</sub>)</strong> conductance both limit photosynthesis 

> - Limitations result from costs and tradeoffs
> - <strong>We know little about these relationships within canopies</strong>

> - Are shade leaves optimized for low light or to respond to occasional high light

> - Beyond just photosynthetic capacity

> - g<sub>s</sub> responds slowly

> - g<sub>m</sub> anatomicaly constrained

> - <strong>Unfortunately, not enough empirical data available</strong>

> - Measuring two canopy extremes
>  - Sun: top of canopy in full light
>  - Shade: bottom and middle canopy in full shade
>  - Verified with quantum sensor and ceptometer

> - Leaves measured at current light environment
>  - Paired WTC compairsons
> - 'Lights On' for shade leaves
>  - Max sunfleck response
